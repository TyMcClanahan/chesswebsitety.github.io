        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p>To improve at something you must make an effort to improve instead of hoping you will improve over time.
          A lot of the reason there is no improvement is because chess is one of my favorite games to play when I am
          tired so there isn't a lot going on in my brain during these games.
          Chess is a super interesting and complex game to learn. Being able to harvest your own stats and finding your
          weaknesses allows you to study specific aspects that will help you improve faster.
          Most of the big gamechanging data would be gathered by looking specifically at the individual moves in each
          game to
          figure out what you have to do better next time.
          If you are interested in chess I would highly recommend learning it or getting back into it as I think that it
          is
          such a fun game to play.</p>
